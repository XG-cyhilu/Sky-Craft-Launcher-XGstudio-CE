A Minecraft launcher developed by **OMS Work!**, built with Electron, React and TypeScript. It uses a single floating-window design and supports vanilla Minecraft plus the major mod loaders.

## Features

### Interface

- **Single window with dynamic resizing** — the launcher, manager pages and dialogs resize the window smoothly while keeping the animation rhythm
- **Floating cards** — a frameless, transparent window with separated layers for cards, the dock and the background
- **3D cursor tilt** — the card subtly follows the pointer; strength is adjustable and can be disabled completely
- **Notification system** — separate transparent always-on-top windows; multiple notifications stack from the top and slide up when one leaves
- **Dark mode** — light, dark or follow system, using a space-gray palette
- **English / Chinese UI** — switchable at runtime

### Versions and launching

- Vanilla releases and snapshots, with BMCLAPI mirror and automatic fallback to Mojang
- **Fabric / Quilt / Forge / NeoForge** installation
- Reads **Modrinth App** instances and versions and launches them directly
- **mrpack** modpack import (detects the loader, installs required dependencies, extracts overrides)
- Full version inheritance, rule evaluation and argument-template expansion
- Native libraries selected per OS/architecture, including the `natives/java` layout used by 26.x
- Legacy versions (1.12.2 and older) automatically use Java 8; on Apple Silicon an x64 Java 8 is downloaded and run through Rosetta
- Pre-1.6 versions get a generated `assets/virtual` directory
- **Crash analysis** — on abnormal exit a dialog explains Java version issues, missing dependencies, module conflicts, native library failures, out-of-memory and more

### Java

- Detects system JDKs, `JAVA_HOME`, `PATH` and Mojang runtimes
- Automatically downloads a **Zulu JRE** when no suitable Java is found (Adoptium fallback)
- Picks Java according to the version requirements; legacy versions are pinned to Java 8

### Downloads

- Mods, resource packs and shaders powered by **Modrinth**
- Filter by game version / loader; sort by downloads or newest
- Automatically installs required mod dependencies
- Manages resource packs, shaders, saves and server lists

### Accounts

- Offline accounts (username + offline UUID)
- Microsoft account login (OAuth device-code flow)

### Extras

- Live logs with filtering and export
- **Bug reporting** — attaches redacted logs, system information, mod list and screenshots; falls back to a local zip on the Desktop if submission fails
- An easter egg called “Treasure Box”

## Download

Get builds from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SodiumMC/Sky-Craft-Launcher/releases):

- macOS (Apple Silicon): `SCL-<version>-arm64.dmg`
- Windows x64: `SCL-Setup-<version>-x64.exe`

> The builds are not notarized by Apple. If Gatekeeper blocks the first launch, allow it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, or right-click the app and choose **Open**.

You can also build from source — see below.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SodiumMC/Sky-Craft-Launcher.git
cd Sky-Craft-Launcher
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` builds the main process, preload script and renderer, then launches Electron.

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Build and launch |
| `npm run build` | Build main process + preload + renderer |
| `npm run build:main` | Build the main process only |
| `npm run build:renderer` | Build the renderer only (Vite) |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type checking |

### Packaging

macOS (Apple Silicon):

```bash
npx electron-packager . SCL --platform=darwin --arch=arm64 \
  --out=release --overwrite --asar --prune=true \
  --app-bundle-id=studio.scl.launcher --app-version=<version> \
  --icon=build/icon.icns
```

Windows (NSIS installer):

```bash
npx electron-builder --win nsis --x64
```

Artifacts are written to `release/` and `release-installer/`.
